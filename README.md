# changme

A default credential scanner.

## About

As a pen tester I've run into numerous instances where commercial vuln scanners miss common default credentials. Getting default credentials added to commercial scanners is often difficult and slow. changeme is designed to be simple to add default credentials without having to write any code using the `mkconfig.py` script.
